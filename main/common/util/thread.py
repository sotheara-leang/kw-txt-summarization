'''
    A generic iterator and generator that takes any iterator and wrap it to make it thread safe.
    This method was introducted by Anand Chitipothu in http://anandology.com/blog/using-iterators-and-generators/
    but was not compatible with python 3. This modified version is now compatible and works both in python 2.8 and 3.0
