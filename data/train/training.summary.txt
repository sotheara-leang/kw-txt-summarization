the fantastic flexibility of features makes this car great for families .#S#the car is highly rated with more emergency braking and stability control .#S#only the 2.2 litre sd4 diesel version will be on sale in the uk .#S#just in time for the christmas break , i took the handsome new seven - seater discovery sport to iceland — no , not the high street frozen food chain , but a proper epic across ice and snow - covered landscapes on that viking island south of the arctic circle .#S#we may have been promised a disco inferno near the still - smouldering volcanoes , but it was more like ice station zebra on the road . i ' ve never seen so many fur - clad parkas since a screening of the mod film quadrophenia .#S#this was no road test for sissies . i do n't recall meeting any tarmac outside reykjavik . most of the crosscountry driving was on thick ice , thin ice , or snow . there was a constant threat of blizzard when , i ' m told , visibility drops to nil . thankfully the winter tyres and onboard safety features were up to it .#S#on looks alone it 's a winner . it may be a replacement for the freelander , but it 's bigger , smarter , more luxurious and flexible , even though the engine and much of the underpinnings remain the same .#S#great for families , thanks to fantastic flexibility . there are five seats for everyday use . but two extra ones pop up from the rear to create a magnificent seven .#S#the willing 2.2 litre sd4 diesel is linked to a smooth 9-speed zf automatic gearbox and accelerates briskly from rest to 62 mph in 8.4 seconds so it 's pretty nimble around town and when cruising , as well as off road . top speed is 117 mph . co2 emissions are a fair 161 g / km , helped by a ' stop - start ' system .#S#there 's the option of manual override via paddles on the steering wheel . and boy did i use them as i traversed slippery glaciers and stormed up steep , snowclad hills . for winter in britain , it 'll do the job .#S#the hill - descent control was a godsend . it takes control of the low gearing and braking to give you a reassuringly confident descent .#S#it 's been built with about 2 ft ( 600 mm ) of wading depth , with a short overhang at the front and rear to help you cross shallow rivers and fords .#S#the car has achieved the top 5-star rating with more emergency braking and stability control systems than you could wave a stick at — plus a pedestrian airbag .#S#a comfortable and comforting interior with a commanding view of the road ahead and ample head and legroom in the back .#S#it goes on sale on january 22 , with first deliveries set for late february .#S#not the cheapest 4x4 by far and the ' extras ' will soon mount up . you are paying a hefty premium for the badge and the engineering expertise behind it .#S#only the 2.2 litre sd4 diesel version will be on sale in the uk , no petrol option .#S#there will be a ' greener ' two - wheel - drive version soon , producing a 119 g / km and costing less than £ 30,000 . great for looking the part , but frankly if you 're going to buy a proper land rover , why have one that 's not a 4x4 ?#S#the hill descent control button needs to be more prominent so you could whack it into play in transit — when you suddenly realise you need it — rather than groping to find it .
