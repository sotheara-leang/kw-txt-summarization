sanford , florida ( cnn ) -- george zimmerman was booked into jail sunday after surrendering to authorities before an afternoon deadline , the seminole county sheriff said . zimmerman met two members of the sheriff 's office in a business parking lot about 1:25 p.m. sunday and was taken into custody , sheriff donald eslinger told reporters . zimmerman was required to return to central florida and turn himself in after a judge revoked his bail friday , saying zimmerman misled the court about his finances . zimmerman , a neighborhood watch volunteer , is accused of shooting unarmed teenager trayvon martin in a gated community in sanford in february . zimmerman argues he acted in self-defense . police : martin 's death ' ultimately avoidable' eslinger said zimmerman , who will be housed in administrative confinement at seminole county 's john e. polk correctional facility , was `` quiet and cooperative . '' he was being held on a no-bail status , the sheriff 's office said . video from the jail showed zimmerman exiting a white minivan , wearing handcuffs , jeans and a long-sleeve shirt , escorted by authorities . zimmerman 's cell is designed to hold two inmates and is about 67 square feet , the sheriff 's office said . it is equipped with two beds and a toilet . inmates are not provided access to televisions , authorities said . it was not clear from the sheriff 's office whether another inmate would be in the cell with zimmerman . after being booked , zimmerman will be given an opportunity to purchase items at the commissary . his balance in the commissary account , posted on the sheriff 's web site , was $ 500 . `` while out on bond , mr. zimmerman has been living in a secure , undisclosed location as there are significant threats against his life , '' his attorneys said sunday on the official website for his defense . documents shed light on florida killing asked how his client spent the weekend , attorney mark o'mara told reporters , `` travel . '' he said zimmerman was worried about coming out of hiding , `` but i think he also realizes the judge 's concerns . '' o'mara said he will be filing a motion monday asking seminole county judge kenneth lester jr. for a new bond hearing to revisit zimmerman 's status and allow the defense to `` explain why what happened seems to have happened . '' zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder in the case that sparked anger across the country . martin 's family contends that zimmerman racially profiled the 17-year-old who was walking home from a convenience store . martin was black ; zimmerman his white hispanic . his family has said zimmerman did not act out of racial bias . opinion : trayvon martin shooting was n't a case of racial profiling lester ordered zimmerman back to jail , saying the 28-year-old was not truthful about how much money he had access to when he was freed on bond in april . lester 's ruling on friday followed allegations by prosecutors that zimmerman had $ 135,000 . at the time , his wife told the court under oath that the family was indigent . zimmerman 's attorneys said they will request a new bond hearing to address the issue . `` the defense team hopes that mr. zimmerman 's voluntary surrender to sanford police will help demonstrate to the court that he is not a flight risk . furthermore , the vast majority of the funds in question are in an independently managed trust '' which zimmerman and his attorneys can not access directly , the statement on his defense website said . asked about the possibility that zimmerman 's wife could be charged with perjury , o'mara said that statement was out of his control . he said his client is worried about himself , his wife and his family -- everyone who had to go into hiding because of the `` enormous anger and hatred '' the case has generated . zimmerman 's trial is not `` anticipated '' to commence until some time in 2013 , the defense statement said , and the next bond hearing will determine whether he waits `` those many months in jail or not . '' zimmerman was charged in april after the case was referred to a state attorney for a review . the money in question appears to have been donated to zimmerman through a website he set up to help with a legal defense fund . citing recorded jailhouse conversations between zimmerman and his wife , prosecutors alleged the two spoke in code when discussing the money in a credit union account , according to a court documents filed friday by state attorney angela b. corey . hln : zimmerman wife talks publicly for the first time in light of that , lester revoked zimmerman 's bond and ordered he turn himself in no later than sunday afternoon . zimmerman `` fully controlled and participated in the transfer of money from the paypal account to defendant and his wife 's credit union accounts , '' corey said in court records . `` this occurred prior to the time defendant was arguing to the court that he was indigent and his wife had no money . '' o'mara said in april that the money raised by the website was put into a trust account that the attorney controls . but in court documents , corey said the money still belongs to the defendant . the judge `` relied on false representations and statements '' by zimmerman and his wife when the court set his bond at $ 150,000 , corey said . zimmerman was required to post only 10 % of that amount . corey argued that the court should revoke the bond or increase it . lester appeared angry that the court had not been told about the money . `` does your client get to sit there like a potted palm and let you lead me down the primrose path ? '' he asked zimmerman 's lawyer . `` that 's the issue . '' judge in zimmerman case no ' soft touch' o'mara said he had discussed the judge 's decision with zimmerman , who was not in court . `` he 's frustrated because he now has to come out of hiding , '' o'mara said in an interview with cnn . `` you need to realize we 're still talking about a 28-year-old who 's being charged with a crime he does not believe he committed , and his whole life has been turned upside down , so i think that it all needs to be kept in context .

( cnn ) -- can we simply enjoy movies without having to fact-check every little thing ? apparently not , because so many people feel compelled to show us how clever they are by attempting to point out factual errors depicted in film after film . news flash : movies are supposed to be an entertaining experience . they are an escape from reality . if you want to learn history or facts , read a book . or if you are too lazy to do that , then google it . we have seen this self-aggrandizing spectacle of people fact-checking movies with two recent films . the first is the current box office champion , `` gravity , '' with the other being `` the butler . '' `` gravity , '' which stars sandra bullock and george clooney , follows a space mission that goes terribly awry . despite its box office success , a chorus of critics have attacked numerous scientific flaws in the film -- such as pointing out the allegedly inaccurate way bullock 's hair floated in zero gravity . but that 's nothing compared to the recent barrage of twitter attacks launched at the film by astrophysicist neil degrasse tyson . his tweets ranged from criticizing the direction space debris was depicted as travelling to more nuanced issues such as faulting filmmakers for showing that the hubble space telescope , the international space station and a chinese space station were , `` all in sight lines of one another . '' this is not the guy you want to sit next to in a movie theater during `` star wars . '' i can just hear him whispering things such as : `` the death star is too big to fly at that rate of speed , '' or `` yoda could never survive in that atmosphere . '' look , `` gravity '' does n't even pretend to be based on anything more than the screenwriter 's imagination . and here 's the biggest thing for people like degrasse tyson to keep in mind : it 's science fiction , for god 's sake ! you would think the `` fiction '' part of `` science fiction '' is something that an astrophysicist could comprehend . and then there 's `` the butler , '' the lee daniels film about a man who served for decades as a butler for various presidents at the white house . this film was attacked by the left and the right for being historically inaccurate . some have cited errors with the film 's account of specific instances of the civil rights movement while others expressed outrage over the way president ronald reagan was depicted -- apparently some view reagan as a deity . here 's a spoiler alert ( and by `` spoiler alert , '' i mean a spoiler to people who have never googled or read anything about the film ) : it was fiction -- that means it was made up . there was no `` cecil gaines , '' the butler character played by forest whitaker in the film . the film does not even purport to be a bio pic . sure , it was loosely inspired by the life of eugene allen , a man who served as a butler in the white house for 34 years for eight presidents , but the film was a fictionalized account . and we saw similar obsessive fact-checking last year with movies such as `` argo '' and `` lincoln . '' i guess we should be thankful that twitter was n't around when `` forrest gump '' was released because people would have gone crazy with tweets over that one . can we agree on something ? a director who is making a documentary should be required to present an accurate recitation of facts and history . but for all other movies , filmmakers should be afforded creative license to make the movie that fulfills their vision of the story they want to tell , even ones based on real events . filmmakers are not historians , nor should they be held to such a standard . consequently , directors must be allowed to add scenes or dialogue that make the film more entertaining , such as the fictionalized depiction in `` argo '' of american diplomats trying to board a plane to escape from iran before they are discovered . so here 's my advice to all you self-appointed movie fact-checkers who are just waiting to pounce on any mistake you detect in a film to show off how clever you are : relax . go to a movie , log off of twitter , silence your phone , sit back , eat some overpriced cold popcorn that 's part of the criminally expensive `` value combo '' and watch the film . you never know -- you might just find that you actually enjoy it . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of dean obeidallah .
a series of al qaeda-based threats to attack american and western targets in europe , as well as threats to launch attacks inside the united states , has caused significant concern inside the u.s. intelligence community , cnn has learned . officials are trying to determine the extent to which the threats may be linked and determine what it may mean about the strength of al qaeda in several countries . while the `` threat stream '' has evolved during the past six months , according to a senior u.s. official , none of the threats has been corroborated . the official said the threats appear to detail `` a lot of activity where intelligence suggests there are operational cells , '' but so far , `` we do not see operational cells of al qaeda inside the united states , '' the official said , although he emphasized it could not be ruled out . u.s. officials as well as analysts have long said they believe al qaeda is focused on attacking outside the united states because of the difficulty in penetrating u.s. homeland security . but these latest threat streams suggest domestic u.s. targets also continue to be looked at by al qaeda . worry no . 1 : al qaeda in the arabian peninsula one of the biggest concerns right now remains efforts by yemen-based al qaeda in the arabian peninsula to attack inside yemen , in europe and inside the united states . the u.s. embassy , which was closed several weeks ago , is now expected to remain closed for several more days because of a `` credible threat stream , '' a second senior u.s. official told cnn . while it 's believed aqap is mainly focused on targeting inside of yemen , officials say an attempt to attack inside the united states or to recruit others to carry out such an attack can not be ruled out . worry no . 2 : core group in pakistan separately , still another official confirms to cnn that the core al qaeda group in pakistan is also seeking to place operatives in places to attack u.s. targets overseas and domestically . u.s. officials confirm an operative who uses the code name abdullah al-shami , who is living in pakistan , may now be heading that group 's efforts to plan external attacks . the new york times first published al-shami 's name in february and noted that u.s. intelligence believes he was born in the united states but moved to the middle east as a child . the new york times reported that as an american-born citizen , al-shami could be a target for attack by a u.s. drone . u.s. officials refused to comment , but a private sector analyst who has followed the matter in detail told cnn that killing al-shami had been discussed in the past . if al-shami indeed is activity pursuing attacks against the u.s. , it would indicate that the core al qaeda group in pakistan might be resurgent in its capabilities . worry no . 3 : spillover effects from syria the third threat stream continues to come from syria . u.s. officials tell cnn they believe 70 or more americans have traveled to syria to fight , and many may have returned home along with other fighters with western passports . over the past several months , the u.s. has sought to closely track all americans traveling to syria . earlier this month , the treasury department imposed sanctions on an alleged al qaeda operative , abd al-rahman muhammad zafir al-dubaysi al-juhni . treasury said that in 2013 , he was part of a group of senior al-qaeda members in syria formed to conduct external operations against western targets . it 's also believed al-juhni was in pakistan at some point , putting him in a position to have interacted with al-shami .
( cnn ) -- security forces have begun removing tanks from the volatile syrian city of hama , a sign that the tensions there could be easing . ammar qurabi , chairman of the national organization for human rights in syria and omar habbal , a prominent opposition activist in hama told cnn that tanks just inside the city are withdrawing . hama has been wracked with violence and a general strike this week after a series of peaceful demonstrations , including a huge anti-government demonstration on friday . president bashar al-assad fired the hama provincial governor on saturday and security forces moved to the outskirts of the city . a fierce crackdown ensued in the area , with activists and human rights watch reporting many arrests and deaths . qurabi said 34 people were killed tuesday and wednesday alone . he and habbal said the general strike called by activists several days ago continues with businesses , schools , and offices across the city closed . residents have created security barriers to protect themselves . `` the city streets are deserted and it is difficult to move thorough the city because of the checkpoints set up on every corner by residents , '' habbal said . syria has denied that a military campaign was under way against hama , even as human rights groups reported deaths , arrests and clashes on the outskirts of the city . `` the syrian army did not enter and will not enter hama , '' a syrian government official told cnn wednesday . `` the army is present at the city 's entrances to facilitate the entry of government employees who live in the hama countryside and work in government offices in the city ; some people in hama prevented them from entering the city by cutting off roads . '' it is unclear whether hama residents will turn out for nationwide demonstrations on friday after muslim prayers . the theme of the protests is `` no dialogue , '' a reference to the government-sponsored dialogue with the opposition members this weekend . demonstrators are calling for all opposition leaders to boycott the initiative . activists have said that , since mid-march , violence has been started by security personnel who have used brute force to break up peaceful demonstrations , but the syrian regime has blamed `` armed groups '' for the bloodshed . the city is a sensitive spot for syrian authorities . in 1982 , it was the scene of a brutal military crackdown targeting sunni muslims by the alawite-dominated government of hafez al-assad , president bashar al-assad 's late father . many thousands were killed , with human rights watch putting the toll at 10,000 .
atlanta , georgia ( cnn ) -- an 18-year-old guatemalan man who doctors say faces almost certain death unless he receives a transplanted heart is surrounded by family as he waits , thanks to the kindness of strangers . juan gonzalez was earning $ 250 a week as a dishwasher when his heart trouble began . juan gonzalez , now lying in a hospital in atlanta , hopes to learn friday whether he will be added to the list of people eligible to receive transplants . doctors at st. joseph 's hospital said gonzalez appears to be a good candidate . without a transplant , they said , he could die in six months . the teen traveled alone to rome , georgia , to earn enough money to help support his family back home . the undocumented worker took a job as a dishwasher for $ 250 a week . that 's when heart trouble stepped in . dr. frank stegall , a cardiologist at redmond regional medical center in rome , told gonzalez he had a chronically weak heart , or dilated cardiomyopathy . the organ pumps only 20 percent of the blood a healthy heart would , stegall said . as his heart failed , gonzalez 's plight moved the hospital staff to try to reunite him with his parents . they contacted u.s. rep. phil gingrey -- himself a doctor . gingrey persuaded the state department to expedite travel visas for pascual and maria gonzalez , and delta air lines provided a free ride . last month , cnn aired a story on juan gonzalez . afterward , the larry king cardiac foundation -- founded by the cnn talk show host 21 years ago to pay for life-saving cardiac care for patients without insurance who do n't qualify for state or federal assistance -- helped get gonzalez transferred to st. joseph 's hospital in atlanta for evaluation . many of the people who saw the story on cnn were moved to offer help . it was then that the possibility of a heart transplant became real , thanks to a large donation from one of those people . the donor has asked that details of the gift not be revealed , other than his name , sam shapiro . gonzalez and his parents say they are grateful for the overwhelming support . st. joseph 's has provided housing for the parents at a nearby hotel . although it is not clear where gonzalez will go once the evaluation at st. joseph is completed , staff members at redmond in rome , about 60 miles northwest of atlanta , indicated they might provide a place for the parents to say . the parents ' visas will run out in about two and a half months . cnn 's anna armas contributed to this report .

wilmington , delaware ( cnn ) -- sen. joe biden was always in charge when he was a boy , his younger sister said . not because he bullied the other kids , but because he appealed to their `` better angels . '' joe biden greets supporters at a rally in battle creek , michigan , on august 31 . `` he was always the guy who led the pack , and it was n't because he stood up and pounded his chest and said , ' c'mon and follow me , ' '' his sister , valerie biden owens , said . `` the kids just naturally followed him . '' owens , who is three years younger than the 65-year-old vice presidential candidate , said she was her brother 's sidekick when the two grew up in their scranton , pennsylvania , neighborhood with their brother and sister . `` i opened my eyes , and he was there , '' she said . `` he always taught that i could stretch . he encouraged me to achieve and try things that i would never have tried before , '' she said . biden `` was the kid who brought all the kids into the pack '' and was a boy `` who did the right thing , and did the right thing by other kids , '' owens said . watch biden revealed in documentary » '' he was always the fearless leader ... and he 's always , you know , [ saying ] , ' it 's your turn . now , you . try it again . you can do it . go ahead , ' '' she said . owens said her older brother always tried to make kids feel part of the group because he knew what it felt like to feel excluded . one kid in high school called him `` dash biden '' because he stuttered and it took him a long time to pronounce his name , owens said . `` a fierce determination that he was not going to allow an imperfection to hold him back , '' drove him to overcome the stuttering , she said . `` there are not excuses so he had to figure out a way to overcome it , '' owens said . `` he practiced , and he used to take verses from emerson and yeats and he would memorize them . '' watch how biden overcame his stutter » stuttering would not be the last -- or even the greatest -- challenge biden would face in his life . shortly after he was elected to the senate in 1972 at age 29 , biden 's first wife , nealia , and a daughter , naomi , were killed in a car accident . his sons , beau and hunter , survived the crash , and biden took the amtrak train from washington to wilmington , delaware , daily to take care of them . after the accident , biden was `` devastated -- his world was gone , '' owens said . but biden `` put one foot in front of the other '' and made sure he took care of his children , she said . `` i think that 's why he connects with people , '' she said . `` as my dad said , ' it 's not how you get knocked down , it 's how quickly you get back up . ' '' follow a timeline of biden 's career » in 1977 , biden married his second wife , jill , who owens said `` put my brother 's life back together . '' `` she not only married my brother , she married the state of delaware . she married the biden family , '' owens said . `` and the whole time [ she ] has kept her perspective and her feet grounded . she 's a remarkable woman . '' now , owens said , biden 's ability to unite people and appeal `` to the better instinct in human nature '' -- the same traits he showed when he was a boy in scranton -- are why he is a good running mate for sen. barack obama , the democratic presidential nominee . `` he never would have signed on and agreed to run with sen. obama unless he thought he could make a difference , unless he believed in sen. obama and where he wanted to lead the country , '' she said . `` they share the same values . they share the same vision . ''
dali , guizhou , china ( cnn ) -- shi wenchang has been an elementary school teacher in this remote rural village for 39 years but he does n't teach his mother tongue , even though it 's used by almost three million people . his job is to get the village , home to members of the dong ethnic group , chattering in putonghua , also known as mandarin -- china 's national language -- although he can switch into the local language -- dongyu -- in the early years to bridge any gaps . `` when they start learning to write , they start learning the han language , '' he says , referring to china 's largest ethnic group , which makes up 90 % of the population and is politically and culturally dominant . teacher shi thinks it 's important they master putonghua , which will enable them to seek work beyond the confines of their isolated village , but fears his language is disappearing . `` if we do n't have our own language , there are many things , many stories from the past that we wo n't have and that will be a big loss . '' the threat is not just the result of an education system that prioritizes the official national language . as china 's economy has boomed in recent years , many have left their villages to work in coastal factory towns and returned more at ease conversing in putonghua than their native tongue . some slip into chinese for even the closest family relationships , calling their mother and father mama and baba . `` before we 'd never use these words , '' he says . `` in our dong language it 's bu ( father ) and nei ( mother ) . '' china is home to 55 ethnic minorities , but only two -- tibetans and uighurs in china 's far west -- get much international attention , usually because of discord with their han chinese rulers and neighbors . the others are dotted around the country , with most , like the dong , clustered in the poorer mountainous regions of southwest china . ostensibly , there is little overt friction with the chinese majority although shi says when he was younger , he was afraid if han people came to the village . as minorities , they are not subject to the strictures of china 's one-child policy but carving out a distinct cultural identity is difficult . china is happy to have the appearance of ethnic diversity , but the wider trend is of gradual assimilation , says june teufel dyer , a professor at the university of miami . `` it 's a wrecking of their culture under the guise of preserving it , '' she says . `` people complain that their folk tales are rewritten to fit communist ideals . '' the dong 's cultural heritage is also weakening as a younger generation adapts to more modern ways . the ethnic group has a strong musical tradition and when teacher shi was a teenager , songs were used for courtship . accompanied by a gang of friends , he stood outside the house of his now wife and declared his love for her in song . `` the girl keeps the door shut and you have to keep singing until they open it and let you in , '' he says , before plucking a stringed instrument off the wall of his living room to demonstrate he still has the knack . however , things have changed since his youth . shi tao , a 25-year-old factory worker back in the village for the birth of his son , laughs when asked if this was how he met his wife . `` our grandparents did this , we do not , '' he says . teacher shi hopes that tourism may reinvigorate the dong 's unique culture and encourage younger people like shi to stay closer to home and engage in traditional pursuits . the village , a picturesque cluster of timber houses surrounded by bamboo groves , has been designated a heritage site and earmarked for tourism development . `` the tourists will come here to see our people 's traditions and culture . if more people come then maybe the preservation of our traditions will be stronger , '' says teacher shi . elsewhere though , tourism has proved , at best , to be a mixed blessing . in villages already on the tourist trail , minority culture is a commodity to sell to passing crowds . `` some villages become human zoos , '' says dyer . `` some are happy about what they get out of it but others resent it . '' this spectacle is on display in nearby xijiang , home to the miao ethnic group , where villagers perform a live show every afternoon in a specially created outdoor amphitheater . it 's standing room only and the audience laps it up . but , with girls performing in mini skirts and skits lampooning the group 's predilection for drinking potent rice wine , it makes some older residents shudder . `` these performances are n't real miao culture , '' says tang cheng , the village chief . `` people just want the entertainment factor . '' the hope is dali will escape the rampant commercialization that has engulfed some minority villages -- its development is being overseen by the provincial bureau of cultural heritage with help from a u.s. ngo , the global heritage fund . both organizations want to preserve the village 's cultural dna and hope it can become a unesco world heritage site . still , the lives of teacher shi 's three children , who all work outside their village , demonstrate that the chances of a cultural revival for the dong are slim . in their 20s and 30s , one is an accountant in wuhan , a large city in central china . the other two are teachers in the same province . they only wear traditional clothes when they come home . shi has no grandchildren yet but is sanguine about the chances of his descendants speaking his native tongue . `` if they are always living outside the village , then they will definitely speak putonghua , `` he says .
bangkok , thailand ( cnn ) -- at least eight people have been killed as thai security forces declared a `` live firing zone '' in downtown bangkok on saturday following days of deadly clashes with anti-government protesters . saturday 's fatality takes the total number of deaths to 25 since a government-backed clampdown on protesters exploded into violence on thursday . more than 150 people have been wounded , according to emergency officials . in a televised address , thai prime minister abhisit vejjajiva said a small group of protesters among the opposition `` red shirts '' was trying to foment civil war . the prime minister urged the citizenry to understand and embrace the government 's stance . the country could n't allow the rule of law to fail , he said , warning that the longer the protests continued , the higher the risk for the public . `` the government proposed a reconciliation plan but it was rejected , '' abhisit said . `` this benefits no one . it only benefits a small group which wants to harm the country and lead it to civil war . it is unbelieveble that they use peoples lives for political advantage . '' thousands of red shirts , who support ousted former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , have been occupying a central area of the city for weeks in a show of opposition to abhisit . the escalating unrest prompted the u.s. embassy to issue a travel warning saturday advising americans to defer travel to bangkok , spokeswoman cynthia brown told cnn . several other western embassies , including the uk , japan , canada , new zealand and the netherlands have also advised against travel to bangkok . tensions remained high saturday , with protesters yelling and screaming as they stood behind barricades of tires , spikes and bamboo poles . ireport : are you there ? send your images , video but a military spokesman said security forces planned to put the protesters under more pressure saturday as they cordoned off an area of several square kilometers , cnn 's sara sidner reported . `` in the next few days , they will be stepping up their security measures , '' said panitan wattanayagorn , the acting thai government spokesman . security forces rolled out razor wire and erected warning signs as they surrounded the area where the protesters have been clustered , cnn 's dan rivers reported . he said thai troops had also come under fire although it was unclear who was shooting at them . `` there 's been quite a fierce gunfight where we are in the northwest corner of this zone that they have tried to surround a ratchaprarop road which has been declared a live fire zone by the army , '' said rivers . `` there are signs up all along it warning residents to stay indoors , that there is live ammunition being used . we 've been effectively pinned down while the army tries to deal with incoming fire . we 're not sure who 's firing on them but it 's certainly been a very volatile situation with lots of explosions and gunfire going on . '' sidner , a few kilometers away inside the security force 's cordon reported witnessing two people shot . both appeared to be unarmed she said . those present at the scene claimed rooftop snipers were responsible for the shootings , she said . `` the protesters clearly blame the army for the deadly force , '' said sidner . `` there is no way to know for sure who exactly is doing the shooting but neither of the people we saw injured were armed . '' on the scene : bangkok at boiling point the thai capital has been in chaos since thursday , beset by gunfire , tear gas and stone-throwing that boiled over after thai authorities set a new deadline to seal off the bangkok intersection where protesters have gathered by the thousands for the past month . what are protests about ? a government official said thai forces were slowly getting control of the downtown area , with video footage showing soldiers shooting rounds toward the area with protesters . among those wounded on friday was a journalist from a french television station who was shot in the leg . the government said it was forced to take action after demonstrators disregarded an ultimatum by prime minister abhisit vejjajiva to vacate the intersection by wednesday . wattanayagorn said friday that security forces who have been the objects of attacks have no choice but to respond . he told reporters that forces have been dutifully following the rules of engagement , which allow them to use live ammunition to protect themselves and their comrades . he assured bangkok residents and foreigners that the forces have no intention of harming anyone . the government , he said , is `` very confident '' it will be able to `` stabilize the situation '' and get it `` under control very soon . '' also , he said the prime minister is looking forward to working with others in hammering out reforms . the united front for democracy , the formal name of the red shirt opposition , has been demanding that abhisit dissolve the lower house of parliament and call new elections . the red shirts support former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , who was ousted in a bloodless military coup . tensions ramped up when maj. gen. khattiya sawasdipol -- a renegade general better known as seh daeng , which means red commander -- was shot and wounded by a sniper 's bullet thursday , leaving him in critical condition . brown , of the u.s. embassy in bangkok , said that family members of embassy personnel had been offered voluntary departure . she said the embassy would remain closed on monday and that staff were assessing the situation `` day to day .
